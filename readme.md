# Express Server

> A simple server that serves a stock simulation.

## Credits

I'm building this project off of my coworkers 'simple-server' project [documented here](https://github.com/cmda-be/course-17-18/tree/master/examples/express-server). All credits for the work in the first commit go to [@woooorm 2018](https://github.com/wooorm). I've used his project because it's clean and has neat, well-documented code, as well as a basic setup I intend to use/abuse for my purposes.

## Install
[npm][]:

```bash
TBC
```
